## 🚀 Project Overview

This project implements an **end-to-end machine learning system** designed to support finance and procurement teams by:

1. **Predicting expected freight cost** for vendor invoices.
2. **Flagging high-risk invoices** that require manual review due to abnormal cost, freight, or operational patterns.

The system covers the complete ML lifecycle:

* Data extraction from SQL database
* Feature engineering & preprocessing
* Model training with hyperparameter tuning
* Model persistence using `joblib`
* Interactive Streamlit dashboard for real-time inference

## 🎯 Business Objectives

### 1️⃣ Freight Cost Prediction (Regression)

**Objective:**
Predict the expected freight cost for a vendor invoice using quantity, invoice value, and historical purchasing behavior.

**Why it matters:**

* Freight is a significant component of total landed cost.
* Poor freight estimation impacts margin analysis and budgeting.
* Early prediction improves procurement planning and vendor negotiation.

### 2️⃣ Invoice Risk Flagging (Classification)

**Objective:**
Predict whether a vendor invoice should be flagged for manual approval due to abnormal cost, freight, or delivery patterns.

**Why it matters:**

* Manual invoice review does not scale efficiently.
* Financial leakage often occurs in large or complex invoices.
* Early risk detection improves audit efficiency and operational control.

---

## 🗄 Data Sources

Data is stored in a relational **SQLite database (`inventory.db`)** containing:

* `vendor_invoice` – Invoice-level financial and timing data
* `purchases` – Item-level purchase details
* `purchase_prices` – Reference purchase prices
* `begin_inventory`, `end_inventory` – Inventory snapshots

SQL aggregations are used to generate invoice-level features such as:

* Total item quantity
* Total item dollars
* Average receiving delay
* Days from PO to invoice
* Days to payment

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA focused on business-driven questions:

* Do flagged invoices have higher financial exposure?
* Does freight scale linearly with quantity?
* Does freight depend on invoice value?
* Are delayed deliveries associated with invoice risk?

Statistical tests (t-tests) were performed to confirm whether flagged invoices differ significantly from normal invoices.

## 🤖 Models Used

### 🔹 Regression (Freight Prediction)

* Linear Regression (baseline)
* Decision Tree Regressor
* ✅ Random Forest Regressor (final model)

---

### 🔹 Classification (Invoice Flagging)

* Logistic Regression (baseline)
* Decision Tree Classifier
* ✅ Random Forest Classifier (final model with GridSearchCV)

Hyperparameter tuning is performed using **GridSearchCV** with **F1-score** to handle potential class imbalance.

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

### Freight Prediction

* MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
* RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
* R² Score

---

### Invoice Flagging

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-score
* Classification report
* Feature importance analysis

---

## 🖥 End-to-End Application

A **Streamlit web application** demonstrates the complete ML pipeline:

✔ Input invoice details
✔ Predict expected freight cost
✔ Flag invoices in real time
✔ Provide human-readable approval recommendations

Users can switch between:

* Freight Cost Prediction
* Invoice Manual Approval Flag
